Lll INTRODUCTION

OWhich‘ ⁵⁰ fflf ³5 thet can he made out, seem to bear on Sicco's

immediate and subsequent revision ol the text and on his growth >

in knowledge ol correct Latin usage. When an erasure is indicated

in the apparatus, the letters within a parenthesis are not in erasure,

i. e. maglnus) means that only the first three letters are in erasure. <

Α note such as erat relgnuml) means that Sicco wrote re but changed

that immediately to something else before completing the word J

intended, and that my guess is that he originally intended to write

regnum. But a note written re(gnum).² means that re is clear, while

the rest is a guess. hhbreviations are ordinarily not indicated,

hut in a lew cases where some special point is involved the omitted
letters are put in parenthesis. This is done only where there is no
chance ol confusion withan erasure.

ln the notes below the text l have tried to give the sources ol
Sicco’s actual quotations only, but occasionally, especially in the
lite of Caesar, l have given luller relerences to the sources in order
to show how his biographies were patched together. lt is expected
that one ol the collaborators in this edition will· make an extended

study ol Sicco's sources lor a doctoral dissertation.
