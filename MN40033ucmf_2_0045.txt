the other in the possession of an unnamed Paduan patrician. The
latter is perhaps lo. Rhodius, since he was a close friend 61Ρὶ-
gnoria (l). The other manuscript to which Pignoria referred may
ἦ be one of the known ones. One at least, Ρ, must have been in Padus
ξ in his time, since it is there 11611121. Vossius got his information
between 1627, the date of his first edition, which did not contain
j Pignoria’s statement, and l63l, the date of Pignoria’s death. To· ⁴
’ masini's catalog ο1 Paduan manuscripts, containing reference to
Rhodius' manuscript and one in S. Giovanniy in Veniam, appeared
1111639.

lVlanuscripts containing parts only of Sicco's worlr are the ‘fol--
lowing:

Venice, Marc. lat. cl. X, 3l. Contains the life of Suetonius.
Possihly the basis for the text of this biography given in the· edition
of Suetonius published at lVlilan in 1491. Ι have examined'neither.

Venice, lVlarc. it. cl. IX, 53. Contains, without author’s name,

the life of ,Petrarch following the Italian poems of that author.
Oxford, Bodl. Canon. ltal. 70. Same contents as preceding,
,, Oaford, Bodl. Canon. Ital. 73. Same contents as preceding (3)
lVlodena, Estens. lat. XVII. GC. 23. Contains only the discus-

’ (2) This is probably the manuscript which Polenus told Kapp (op. y
cir, p. 11 31) in 1733 (or shortly before) was in a Paduan monastery.

(3) These three manuscripts evidently form one group. They are no
doubt to be identified with three similar manuscripts mentioned by To· ι
masini, Petrarcha Redivioas, 1635, p. 44 (ed. 2, 1650, p. 35), one in S. Gio·
vanni in Vardani, Padua, a second belonging 1ο lohannes Reinst 0111111κ
sterdam the third owned by D. Gaffarelli. This was a parchment man· ’
uscript dated 1463. l heve not examined any of the three existing man-
uscripts for this date. Apparently it was this date that misled Edward
H. R. Tatham (Froncesco Petrnrco, 1, 1925, p. 189) to say that Sicco wrote
the life in that year! The fifteenth century (undated) edition of Petrarch's

poems which contains this life is perhaps based on one of these three man-
uscnpts.
