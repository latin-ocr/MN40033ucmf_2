abandoned the word belore he finished copying Ο; in 465.15 he

uses permulti. whereas F still has plurr‘que.

The word leviare lor levare Sicco got lrom his manuscript 01
Donatus, as Sahbadini has shown (1). 11 is interesting to note his
care in preserving this mistahen form, lor in 40415 he correers
levandas to leviandas. - ,

ln 24.l7 it may be presumed that Sicco originally wroteaegrr'-

tudines, as in H. The correction to aegrotationes was no doubt
due to reading Cicero Tusa. lll. tt: nt aegrotatio r'n corpore, sr'c
aegritudo in animo. ⁴ '

ln 12230 Sicco quotes Pliny to the ellect that Silius ltalicus com-

mitted suicide on account 01 a tumor (clavi). The exact meaning
was not clear to him, lor he put in the margin 'the gloss .r'. chali.
The latter word (properly spelled callam), meaning “callous‚ ”
is an approximate synonym lor clavus only in the meaning ‘⁶ corn. ”
Modern editors agree that the clavus in tlre case ol Silius was some*
thing worse than a corn.

in the active sense 1518. Ocalarr'a is used in the sense 01 ‘⁶ eye-
