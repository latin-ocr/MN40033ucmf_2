ln addition to the early printed editions mentioned by Segarizzi,
the Vittorio Emmanuele library in Rome has an edition printed
at Venice by Bartholomeus de Zanis de Portesio in l503. lt is
probably a copy 01 the edition 01 1477.

Lives of Scints

Pardua, Antoniana XXII, 559. Written in l437 and presented
to the library by Sicco himself. ¹'she best copy ol the work, but
not autograph. See p. xvi.

Venice, Marc. lat. cl. IX, 182. Written by Sicco's brother
Francesco in 1464. See above, p. x.

Rome, Vallicelliana H. 80: Brussels 8932: padua, Bibl. Civ.
Β. Ρ. 93; Ambivio del Museo Civica Bibl. Univers. l683.

De Confessione

London,British Museum 14809, Parchment. Written before
14511. Perhaps identical with the copy which was once in the library
ol the Eremitani in Padua (Tomasini, Bibliothecae Patavinae Ma-

anserinae, 4639, p· 75).
Padua, Antoniana XXII, 565. The catalog 01 the library calls

it an autograph. This it surely is not. Contains the date 14411,
but probably written much later. Perhaps a copy 01 the lVlodena
manuscript, which Segarizzi says is dated l440.

Modena, Estense lat. Vll. F. l7; Venice, Marc. lat. cl. Ill, 81;
lVlarc. lotch Ill, 82; Marc. lat. cl. 111, 137; Rome, Vat. lat. 7781.
One 01 the Venice manuscripts is probably the one owned by Far-
setti (Biht. monoscritta di Tommaso Giusepoe Fcrsetti, Venice, 1771,
p. l24, No. LXX1V; paper). This catalog refers to two other
manuscripts 01 this work, one in the Biblioteca Zeniana, the other
in S. Giorgio Maggiore, Venice. Probably these are to be identified
with the other two manuscripts now in Venice.
