PREFAOE

, While several ol Sicco Polenton's minor works have been pub·
lished‚ the present is the first edition olbis magnum opus, on which he

ι’ spent 25 years. lt has long been lmown'lthrough the publication ,

2 01 small portioris and its value has been commented upon atvarious
times, but its bulla has apparently deterred scholars 110111 attempt·

J? ing to publish it, though an abortive attempt was made by Kapp

J in· the eighteenth century.

The importante 01 the work is two-lold: first, 11 gives a fine

idea ol the extent ol the knowledge 01 Classical Latin authors in

the first 11011 01 the filteenth century. WhileSicco omitted menn
tion ol some works that were known to some 01 his contemporaries,
it is still true that one could write a rather good account ol the signil-

icance and scope 01 the 11010110οῃ00110111111101100101000. ln the
' second place, the' discussion 01 the various authors 011011 throws val·

³ Ῐ 1101110113111011110101110111110111 tradition 01 these authors. The

work is not, to be sure, a great piece 01 literature, nor was Sicco ⁵

one 01 the greatest 01 the humanists. lts interest 101 us is pure-

ly historical. 1 .
The desirability 01 publishing Sicco's troes has olten been point-

ed out. T'ypical are the following expressions:
