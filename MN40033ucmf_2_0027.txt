Paduanss -His most notable teacher was Giovanni da Ravenna, who
taught at Padua from l392 to 1411411110 1396 Sicco became
a'notary of the ruling Carrara family. He obtained Paduan citi-
zenship between March l5‚' 14112 and June 29, 1411312). Perhaps

soon after'this he became a public notary‚ though we cannot be cer·

i tain that this took place before llll. That he became chancellor of

Padua in l40⁴l is the contention of Segarizzi, but the argument for
this incredibly early date is based on 0 misinterpretation. Sega·
rizzicites the will of Cardinal Pileo da Prata, which we have only
in a printed form of the seventeenth century. In this will Sicco
signs himself as chancellor. The printedtext reads as follows:

«Anno a Nativitate Christi llllillesimo quadrigentesimo quarto
indictione secunda, etc.. >r

hs the date and the indiction do not agree, Segarizzi changed
secundo of the indiction to decima secunda. But the objections to
this are insurmountable: the Latinity of decimo secundo is unusual,
and the date of the document would be far too early, as it makes

Sicco chancellor 'onlyafew monthsafterbecomingnotary. Sega- = ·

rizzi himself indicates other objections: the document submitting the
surrender of Padua to Venice in 1405 is signed by two notarios, not
’ by Sicco. who, it would seem, ought to have signed as chancellor.
² Furthermore Sicco does not sign himself as chancellor in any extant
document until 1417, though, 10 be sure, even after that date he
sometimes signs himself merely as notary. ln view of all these
objections it seems simpler to change the year to match the indiction
rather than vice versa Therefore we read:

dictione secunda, ete.»
