¹ · One ol the most lascinating periodsin the history· ol the world
lor the student and one olthe most important in its inlluence on
the luture ol mankind was the ltalian Renaissa'nce. Startingwith
a reawahened interest in the ancient Latin authors, especially Cic-
ero, it spread into ever wider fields and ultimately gave us all
our modern literature, art, and science. ’ ’

We are accustomed to say that Petrarch was the first modern
man. Granting that no one person can start a movement so vast as
the Renaissance‚ it is still true that he stands out as a giant among
the rest. His passion lor the ancient authors, most ol all lor Cicero,
was so intense that it is hard lor us, living in the later days when

the first heat has cooled off, to understand it. And what led to this¹ ¹ i

passion? lt was the desireto know things, to know about the'world
’ and its people. That world was lound inthe bootsoltheancients:
·- People were hecoming weary, apparently, ol the tancies ol the Mid-
dle Ages and craved the more substantial lood oi truth„ This
craving was one ol the primary lorces in the revival ol learning.
There were no doubt many lactors which made it inevitable that
ltaly should he the place, that the trecento should be the century,
and that Petrarch should he the manto begin the movement. <Pe-

’ trarch was an ltalian, hut he spent many years in France. He thus
came into contact with that country which even more than ltaly
itsell had perpetuated the traditions ol antiquity and produced

a series ol lesser revivals ol learning during the Middle hges.
Petrarch searched lar and wide lor books hy ancient authors and
interested his lriends in the search. ’ Most prominent ol them-was
Boccaccio. Both bewailed theneglectedcondition ol libraries and
both succeeded in saving lrom the rubbish heap important worhs
which otherwise wouldv not have heen preserved to us.
