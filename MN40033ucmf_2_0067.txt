Following Macrobius are selections 11010 the Scriptores Historiae
Augustae (l. 141) 10 the same hand. There are no notes by Sicco,
unless some 01 the many symbols lor Nota were made by him.
These selections are followed by another independent manuscript
(ninth century) containing Fulgentius. There is no evidence that
Sicco was acquainted with this author, so that this part ol the col-
lection probably was not in his possession.

xiv. Tua Pomaria 01 Sicco

Pal. lat. 1478 has been described above as a manuscript ol Cicero’s

Loschi, in part by Sicco Polenton. Not only is Sicco’s hanelwriting
to be 1011011 10 this manuscript, as already indicated, but it is clear
that the manuscript was made lor him. The outlines, both Sicco’s
and Loschi's, are much brieter than they are in other manuscripts in
which they alone are found without the text 01 the orations. The
order is not determined by the authorship 01 the outlines, 101 the
Sicconian outlines with their orations are in the order 9, 111, 11,
12, 13, 15, 20, 21, 14, 16, 22, 23 (l) Thus three 01 Loschi's outlines ’

manuscript itsell to indicate which outlines are Sicco’s and which are
Loschi's. How greatly the Argumenta have been cut‘ down, ob-
viously by Sicco himself, is shown by the lact that the one 101 the

’ first oration contains 337 words, while in the usual 101111 11 has about

6181) words.

The manuscript is thus primarily a copy 01 Cicero's 0111110111.

, The scribe in copying 1011 spaces 101 colored initials at the beginning

01 each outline and larger spaces 101 those at 1110 beginning 01 each ’

(l) The missing numbers represent Loschi’s outlines the variation
in the order 01 Siceo's outlines is 11001 the normal order 1011011 10 manu-
Ἴ scripts which give the fuller 10110 01 the outlines.
