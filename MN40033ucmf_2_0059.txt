«Taceo bellicam rem, qua una disciplina, felicitate, virtute non
Graecos modo sed orbis etiam universam gentem, reges, populos
infinitis victoriis,v amplissimo imperio, immortali gloria superavit.»
This Ciceronian touch became such an obsession with Polenton that
its constant recurrence in his work is exc'eedingly monotonous.
Another device of which Sicco was very fond is the emphatic posi-
tion of the adjective before the preposition. ln some cases he
corrected from the normal to the emphatic position, e. g. 4939
in eo articulo changed to eo in articulo.

Sicco's syntax is in the main classical. The most noteworthy
, exception is his constant use of quod for ut in result clauses, e. g.

K 934:

«provinciam. adeo magnam... esse quod amplecti haud facile
i tota possit.»

His use of the subjunctive is sometimes unusual, especially
ἒ when he makes a subjunctive and an indicative coordinate, c. g.

ξ inan

«ut ab ea quae... vixerat... et... putaretur.»
The following words used by Sicco are not found in Forcellini-

De·Vit. lfthey are found in Du Cange they are marked ‘⁶ D. ”

Ϊ lt is likely that the work contains still other novelties which were
³ overlooked because 'their meaning was obvious.

Beside the above, Sicco uses other words which perhaps belong
a here. He frequently used piurique (usually abbreviated pl'ique)
