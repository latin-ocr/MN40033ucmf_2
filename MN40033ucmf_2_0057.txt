= followed poem 176 (Baehrens), which in the manuscripts has the

title Ovidii Nasonis epigrammate.
· Sicco relers to “lives ” by Plutarch which do not exist. ln

» these Varro was bracketed with Plato and Aristotle, Virgit with Ho-
¹ mer (263.1; 49922). Plutarch is quoted as sayingtha the could find

’ no Greek to pair with Seneca. Presumably these ‘⁶ lives '¹ are
Ξ torgeries produced by one oi the humanistic translatore ol Plutarch.

³ Sicco seems to be the first person to repon the famous note
on Laura found in the Ambrosian Virgil which belonged to Pe·-
trarch (1). tt is more likely, however, that he got it indirectly than
that he examined the manuscript with his own eyes.
