INTRODUCTION XLV

Sicco’s word division, punctuation, and capitalization has been
, ignored throughout in the interest 01 clearness. His overuse 01
punctuation may bc seen in the lacsimiles accompanying this volume.
= As to word division (or lach 01 it) we find such forms as opereprecr'um,
multifacere, proculdubio, plusquam, suasponte, quammaxime, postea·
veroquam, saepequr'dem enimuero. necdum, trium uir, eo cum. But
Sicco is quite inconsistent, and many exceptions are found,
