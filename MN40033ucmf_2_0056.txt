XXXVIII INTRODUCTION

probable explanation 01 these is that be had heard 01 but not seen the
letters prefixed as prelaces to the books 01 the Silvae.

Sicco tells us (11126) that he saw letters which had been inter·¹
changed between Persius and Lucan. ’ Is this a mere elaboration
01 the statement made in the Vita Persii found iu Persius manuscripts
that Persius and Lucan were good friends, or did Sicco have access
to a fuller form 01 the Vita Persii in which the letters were quoted,
just as in Suetonius' 1110 01 Horace we find letters 01 Horace, Mae-
cenas, and Augustus, or was· Sicco deceived by humanistic inven-
tions, as Sabbadini suggests (lh 11 there is anything in the second
suggestion, this luller lorm 01 the Vita Persii may still exist in one 01
the late Persius manuscripts not yet studied. .

‹ ln the >brief lite 01 Aurelius Victor (21229) only the Epitnrnc
is mentioned, and this Sicco quotes several times (80.29; 23029).
Α citation in 47917 can reler to the Epaone equally as well as to
the Caesarm. There is no other citation that can definitely be re-
Ierred to the Caesares, which therefore Sicco probably did not
know. Only two manuscripts 01Ι this work are known at present.
These also arethe only ones which contain the Origo (100110110-
manae, another work which 51000 seems not to have known. The De
Viris Illustrr'bus Sicco cites once (2489) under the name 01 Pliny, as
was customary.

In 8726 Polenton refers to a poem by Ovid on the publication

> 01 the Aeneia Sabbadini (2) rightly identifies this as the epigram

“Temporibus laetis ” (3), but supposes that Sicco’s manuscript
attributed the poem to Ovid. But as none 01 our manuscripts
makes this attribution, so lar as they have been reported, a slightly
different explanation seems more plausible, namely that the poem
had no author's name but was in a collection that followed poema

01 Ovid (as Harl. 5198, Baehrens p. 23), and that this situation led

to a 101εο 1010001100 as to the authorship. Or the poem may have

(1) Le scoperte, etc.. 1905, p.· 176. But Sabbadini misunderstood

Sicco and speaks 01 an interchange 01 letters between Persius and Cornua
tus, instead 01 Lucan.
