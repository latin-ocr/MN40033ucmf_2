While it is surprising that this work has never been published in
its entirety‚ it is even more surprising that the various hits that
have been published have been taken from inferior manuscripts
and that it has not been noticed that in the Vatican library there is .
a manuscript written in Sicco's own hand, in which he made his
linal additions and corrections. As this manuscript has been taken
as the basis lor the present work, this is not only the editio pritt-
ceps hut also the definitive edition oi Sicco's most pretentious book.
