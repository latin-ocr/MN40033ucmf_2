To come back 10 1110Ι 101101 10 Savonarola and 110 bearing on

the date 01 publication 01 Sicco's magnum 00110. 111 11 Sicco speaks
’ 00 if the work were a thing of 1110 past:

«Incitasti me... nunc annus, ni fallor, est tertius, ut... miracula...
sancti Antonii... memorarem. Id enim existimasti equum ac dig-
1101111010,οἰ quemadmodum vitas scriptorum illustrium Latine
lingue seculares ad litteras memoravi, ita... miracula...-absolverem.»
ln fact, the letter implies that the work had been completed two
years earlier. Cranting that the letter was written in the latter
part 01 1435, this would take us back to 1433, 1110 very date which
Scardeonius gives 101 his manuscript 01 Sicco's Lives. 11 may be
therefore that the first 111011- 01 the work was finished in that year
but that Sicco was unwilling as yet to release it until be had polished

> it 011. This polishing he did in spare moments, in the meantime·
devoting himself to 1110 lives 01 the two 510. Anthony and 01 St. Hel-
en. The latest reference in the Lr'ves which can be assigned to the
111011 01 1433 ι10 10 the coronation 01 Sigismond (1433), which is
referred 1000 recent. Α date later than June 27, 1435, 10 indicated
by the phrase Modestum, 0111 r‘rrs 0101110110 civile (8. 2l), as „we
saw above, but this may have been added while Ο was being copied. ’
This seems to be the easiest way 10 100000110 011 the evidence.

Furthermore it seems unlikely 11101 Savonarola had a copy of Sicco's ·

work at 1110111110 01 the latter’s letter to the former. For in this
letter Sicco answers his friends request for information about the
earliest inhabitants 01 the district 01 Venetia 01111 101 011 010100011011
1 the use 01 170ηο110010 the plural. For an answer to the first
question Sicco might well have referred his friend to the discussion
at the beginning of the life 01 Livy (l76.l5)‚ though. 10 be sure,
he answers the question more fully in the letter.

Accepting then the date 14371011110 writing 01 O 11 remains to
vspeak of the additions and corrections made 111 that manuscript ¹
after the draft was complete. These represent further revisions‚
though they are too tfew perhaps to justi tify the term “editions''
By comparison with the other manuscripts, notably H, which rs

dated July 2l, 1438, we can determine approximately when many of
